                <h3 id="written-biography">Band Biography</h3>
                <p>Formed in 1995 under the influence of sixties garage and surf classics, Croatia based instrumental combo THE BAMBI MOLESTERS won sympathies of rock critics and underground rock audience with their first album “Dumb Loud Hollow Twang”,
                    released in 1997 by “Dirty Old Town”, a small independent label. The whole album, all 15 original songs were recorded during one unbelievable, only three hours long session. Produced by the legendary Californian surf DJ, Phil Dirt,
                    the album soon went out of print.</p>
                <p>Since then the band has regularly been playing all over Europe and their fiery and energetic live performances helped to build their reputation as one of the finest and most original contemporary surf bands. In 1999 the band signed a record
                    deal with Dancing Bear Records to release their second album “Intensity!”. Both, “Intensity!” and “Dumb Loud Hollow Twang” gained positive reviews in music press and were nominated in various categories of Croatian national and independent
                    music awards. During the following couple of years they played with The Cramps, Man or Astroman?, Chrome Cranks, Flaming Sideburns and many more…</p>
                <p>The songs from both albums were regularly played on American (KFJC, KFAI, KXLU, WREK, WHUS) and British radio stations (BBC RADIO 1, John Peel). In 1999 they supported R.E.M. for the first time in Koper, Slovenia. In December 2001 The
                    Bambi Molesters released their third album “Sonic Bullets: 13 From the Hip” (Dancing Bear, WMA, Big Beat). This album features Peter Buck (R.E.M.), Scott McCaughey (Minus 5, Young Fresh Fellows, R.E.M.‘s touring band), The Walkabouts
                    frontman Chris Eckman, American singer/songwriter Terry Lee Hale and Speedo Martinez. The album gained excellent reviews in MOJO magazine, UNCUT magazine, Pitchforkmedia etc.</p>
                <p>In February 2002 The Bambi Molesters played at the New Zealand festival. One of the six shows they did in Wellington was recorded live and broadcasted by the New Zealand national radio.</p>
                <p>First eight months of the year 2003 were spent mostly on the road. They played Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia, one of the shows being the Orange Blossom Special — Glitterhouse Records festival in Beverungen.
                    In July The Bambi Molesters supported R.E.M. on three shows of their European tour (Locarno/CH, Wien/A, Wiesbaden/D).</p>
                <p>Immediately after the touring stopped the band went to studio to re-record their first album, rearranging some of the songs, and adding bonus tracks. The so-called remake of their out-of-print album titled “Dumb Loud Hollow Twang – Deluxe”
                    was released in December 2003. A bonus DVD featuring documentary about the band, “The Bambi Molesters Backstage Pass”, that includes footage shot 1999-2003 (covering band’s different shows as well as Bambi Molesters’ R.E.M. support
                    act gigs) was exclusively added to this release.</p>
                <p>In January 2004 The Bambi Molesters joined forces with Walkabouts’ frontman Chris Eckman and formed “The Strange”. The band worked with Phil Brown (engineer and co-producer) in the Slovenian studio Metro in Ljubljana where they recorded
                    a collaboration album “Nights of Forgotten Films”, released in 2004. Upon release, in Summer 2004 a promo tour took place with special guest Scott McCaughey. Some of the recordings taken live during this tour can be heard on the second
                    The Strange release, “Comin’ Undone” EP, released at the end of the same year.</p>
                <p>In Spring and Autumn 2009 the band recorded new songs for the fourth studio album, “As the Dark Wave Swells”. Album was released at the begining of 2010. Highly acclaimed in the music press (Uncut, Q Magazine, Sunday Times, The Sun), the
                    album reaffirmed The Bambi Molesters as one of the most interesting modern instrumental rock combos. Two years of live shows followed, many of them done in the accompaniment of additional musicians (keyboards and brass section) which
                    instigated the idea of recording a live album and doing a concert movie.</p>
                <p>Latest release, a double live album “A Night in Zagreb” was released in December 2011. It consists of a double CD & DVD featuring the band’s first concert movie, a music “film noir” account of the show done in March the same year, directed
                    by Marc Littler.</p>

                <p>Music attracts him from small feet. His mother was a chemical technician, and his father worked at the refinery laboratory. He encouraged him to play music for him and he was no match against the environment in which he lived, unlike most
                    domestic rockers, rather than just the opposite - a window into a more colorful life. "I played a drum I did not have in primary school, so I hit the probes in a large empty detergent box. Then there was a lack of detergent, so when
                    I entered the bus, the old people were jealous because they were interested in where I bought it - says Dalibor. He has gone through various music genres, eventually falling in love with the surf instrument he has met with guitarist
                    Dinko.

                <p>She was born in 1976 in Sisak where she lives and works. She graduated from Literature and English in Zagreb, a musician and translator. She has performed Jack Kerouac, Neil Younga and Orwell Animal Farm, and is the music scene of the
                    The Bambi Molesters bassist group and (since 2004) The Strange group.</p>

                <p>"Dinko was my neighbor, who then played some African music on a guitar, and when I first heard him, I could not believe how good he was. We first started as a vocal band, but when people told us they were instrumental better, I quit singing.
                    I believe we were different from other bands because of that and that helped, "says Dalibor.</p>

                <h3 id="hrvoje">Hrvoje Zaborac</h3>
                <p>We played without bass and drum. But since Sisak is a small town, my friend sent me to a super drummer and so we came to Hrvoje. Lada, his girlfriend who finished the music school, then played the piano. We wondered if he wanted to try
                    us on bass and that's how they came up with Bambies - says Dalibor, who named the band Bambi Molesters for a laugh.</p>
